This web application converts a sequence of images (JPG, PNG, etc.) or pages from a PDF into an MP4 video.
It was originally developed for a class project where students created a series of drawings—each representing 
a frame of an animation—which could then be compiled into a smooth, playable video.

One third party tool you will need is poppler.
